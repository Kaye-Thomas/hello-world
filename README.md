# hello-world
my first repo

My name is Thomas Kaye but my nickname is KTOM which is also an acronym for "Koala Tea Of Mercy".
See my Wikipedia User page to understand the meaning of that particular nickname.
I am an old hobbyist programmer but I am just starting to learn Ruby. I also am learning Git and Atom.
I plan to write some utilities in Ruby for working with WP, particularly for analyzing the Edit History pages.
I will make these utilities FOSS but I am not sure yet which license I will use, possibly MIT like Atom.

This document is released to the public domain effective 20-JULY-2016.
